                    Portable Applications are able to run without being 
                    installed on the computer system itself, meaning that 
                    the application files need to be read from the folder 
                    that the application is stored on instead of on the computers 
                    storage. Some times, if an application does not need to write 
                    files to the root folder, the application can also be run 
                    from read-only storage methods such as CD ROMS. 
                    Portable applications also do not need to write any data 
                    to the windows registry or the users Profile data as all 
                    of the information is written to the storage device that 
                    the application is saved on.

                <h6>Still Confused? Here are the Basic Points.</h6>
                <p class="confused">
                    If you are still confused with the whole concept of portable 
                    applications and how they operate, the main things to consider 
                    are as follows. Portable applications do not write their files 
                    and user logs to the computer that they are being run from and 
                    instead write all relevant files to the folder that they are 
                    located on. In this case, the storage device would be a USB drive 
                    or even cloud storage such as OneDrive or DropBox. When using 
                    portable applications in day-to-day life, it is important to 
                    remember that since they do not need to be installed on the system, 
                    you are in fact able to plug the UB storage device into another 
                    computer you may have access to and simply continue working on 
                    the applications directly from the USB drive, as long as you ensure 
                    that you have saved all of your work to the USB drive, that is.
