                <h2>What are the Benefits?</h2>
                <p class="benefits">
                    There can be many benefits to using a portable application over 
                    a more conventional app that requires installation. The majority 
                    of benefits that you might hear most people discuss are related 
                    to how easy it can be to transfer the apps between computer systems 
                    and complete work wherever a user may have access to a computer. 
                    With the nature of portable apps not needing to be installed on 
                    the computer device, all a user has to worry about when using a 
                    computer system is if they have all of the applications they require 
                    on the storage drive that they are carrying with them. As the 
                    applications will be able to run directly from the storage device 
                    and will not need to save any temporary files to the computers 
                    storage drives or temporary file locations. This benefit itself 
                    provides a wide range of access to the areas and systems that a user 
                    can produce work on, just as long as they have the portable 
                    applications on a storage device that they carry with them.

                <h2>How Easy are they to Use?</h2>
                <p class="para_ease">
                    For many users, portable applications are the way to go. 
                    This is due to how easy it is to use them. Essentially, they are 
                    exactly like regular applications although they allow a user to 
                    use them on several different computers and transport all of their 
                    files around on a storage drive. However, not all applications 
                    were designed as portable apps and therefore are not normally 
                    available in that form. A good way to get around this is the use 
                    of a launcher for portable apps that has been developed with the 
                    intention of creating portable versions of regular apps that people 
                    are able to use instead of regular portable app alternatives. 
                    This launcher can be found at PortableApps.com. Thanks to this handy 
                    piece of software, you can now use a wider variety of portable 
                    applications versions that you may already use in day to day work 
                    such as Gimp, Chrome, FireFox and Notepad++ to name a few.
