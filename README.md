**Basic HTML/CSS website**

Developed as part of the module "Website Design and Development" in semester 1 - Year 1 of Universtiy.

This website was developed to demonstrate a basic understanding of the elements involved in website development such as HTML and CSS coding as well as utilising media queries for layout interactivity.
The topic presented in the website was assigned to me at random with the purpose of providing content to display on the website in a suitable way.
