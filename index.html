                <h2>What are Portable Applications?</h2>
                <p class="what_are_portable_apps">
                    A portable application is defined as a piece of software 
                    that is used on a computer system without having to be 
                    installed on the system itself. This is due to the application 
                    not writing data to the system files and instead, reading and 
                    writing all files to the folder that the application is located in. 
                    Portable applications can be stored on a variety of storage devices 
                    and are able to run from such devices. Since the applications do 
                    not need to be installed on the device that it is being run from, 
                    there is also the possibility of running the application on different 
                    computer systems. This behaviour is what gives the apps themselves 
                    the distinction of being portable, as you have the ability to store 
                    the apps on a portable storage device and use them on any computer 
                    system you may have access to by running them from the storage
                    device directly.

                <h2>Have You Ever Used These?</h2>
                <p class="app_examples">There are many applications that we may use on a daily basis 
                    that we did not even know were portable. These apps can range 
                    from document and text editors, media viewing apps, computer 
                    games and even console emulators. below are some of the applications 
                    that you may already be familiar with.</p>

                    <h6>Blender</h6>
                    Blender is a piece of animation software that can indeed have a 
                    portable version. This would allow you to keep the application 
                    and all of your animation projects on a single memory stick and 
                    be able to work on them on any computer system that you might 
                    have access to.

                    <h6>VisualBoy Advance</h6>
                    VisualBoy Advance is an incredibly popular emulator for the Nintendo 
                    GameBoy consoles. This application lets you play game files on your 
                    computer without having to install a single file. Very appealing 
                    to people who may move around from system to system but want to take 
                    their game save files with them.

                    <h6>Minecraft</h6>
                    Minecraft is an extremely popular game that is now playable on almost 
                    every gaming platform that you can think of. From computer systems, 
                    to home consoles and even mobile phones, Minecraft has gripped the world 
                    with its addictive and creative gameplay. But most people do not realise 
                    that the original PC version of Minecraft, now referred to as Minecraft Java 
                    edition, was actually a portable application that you could  run from 
                    portable storage devices without being installed on the computer.
